# Logo Artwork

The original icon of a tugboat comes from [Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/131644-tugboat-vector).

The composite EPS file was converted to SVG using [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/eps-to-svg).

One of the tugboats as extracted and edited as per the Vecteezy ToCs using Visio.

We use Paint.NET to do final clean up and saving with a transparent background.
