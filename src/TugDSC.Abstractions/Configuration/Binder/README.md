# README for `TugDSC.Configuration.Binder`

The Configration Binder in TugDSC is an adaptation of the standard
[Microsoft Configuration Binder](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.Extensions.Configuration.Binder/)
with some enhancements.

Unfortunately, there is no mechanism to extend the default Binder so this was created by copying
the bits from the official [code repo](https://github.com/aspnet/Configuration/tree/dev/src/Config.Binder)
and making code changes.
