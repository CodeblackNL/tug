This sample module is designed to illustrate how Tug relies on PowerShell commands to perform its functionality. The sample module provides functionality roughly equivalent to Microsoft's native pull server feature as shipped with Windows Server; however, the sample module does not use a database and instead uses text files to persist data. This results in the sample module having very minimal scalability, and it is likely not suitable for production environments. The module must be placed into a legal module path as defined in the PSModulePath environment variable.
