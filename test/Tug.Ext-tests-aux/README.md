# Project `Tug.Ext-tests-aux`

This project is actually an auxilary library to support unit tests within the
`Tug.Ext-tests` project.

It's used to test out the dynamic discovery and loading features within the
Tug Provider extension model and is therefore not directly refernced in the
main unit test project.
